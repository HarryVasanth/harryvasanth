# About me 🦾

👋 Hi! I am Harry. I build stuff, automate the rest, keep things running, and, at times, show up to meetings as the System & Infrastructure Administrator for [@01-edu](https://github.com/01-edu/).
I take pleasure in finding smarter, faster ways to get things done. Outside of work, I swap my rig for running shoes and hit the trails or roads.

🧑‍💻 Got a question or want to chat? My <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@harryvasanth">DMs</a> are always open - don't worry, it's not automated (yet).


<sub> Oh look, you are using [🌘](https://github.com/settings/appearance#gh-dark-mode-only)[🌖](https://github.com/settings/appearance#gh-light-mode-only) mode.</sub>
